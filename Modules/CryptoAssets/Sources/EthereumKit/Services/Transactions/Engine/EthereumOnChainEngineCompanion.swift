     Ethereum Destination addresses.

     - Returns: Single that emits a tuple with the destination address (`destination`) and the reference address
     (`referenceAddress`) for the given `TransactionTarget`.

     When sending a transaction to one of Blockchain's custodial products, we check if a hot wallet address for that product
     is available. If that is not available, reference address is null and the transaction happens as it normally would. If it is available,
     we will send the fund directly to the hot wallet address, and pass along the original address (real address) as the
     reference address, that will be added to the transaction data field or as a the third parameter of the overloaded transfer method.
     You can check how this works and the reasons for its implementation here:
